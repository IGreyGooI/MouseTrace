Description
============
This program displays mouse motion data captured via raw input from windows.
The mouse data displayed is raw, therefore unfiltered. This program also
provides some functionality to save data and graphs.

Usage
======
The top text displays the sample frequency averaged from the ten most recent
samples. The list view displays the last 250 motion samples and their delta
times (in ms) from the previous sample. The next list displays the unique 
absolute motion values.

The [Record] toggle button starts and stops recording of the x, y, and delta
time values to Comma-Separated Value (csv) file.

The [Save Graphs] button saves the graphs as bitmaps. Any previous files are
over-written.

The target graph displays the instantaneous mouse magnitude. This graph is
auto-scaling. The 'Tracers' slider controls the number of tracers to show,
from 1 to 50.

The histograms graph the motion values. The X-axis is the magnitude of
motion, and the Y-axis is the number of motions. The left side is near zero
movement where as the right side is the largest movements. The green bars
represent positive values, and red bars negative. The top graph is X-axis
(left-right) mouse motion and the bottom graph is Y-axis (forward-back) mouse
motion. The histograms are generated from the last 500 motion samples, and,
are auto-scaling.

Notes
======
When the program is run, move your mouse as fast as posible so that the graphs
are scaled to maximum magnitude.

The raw input API is only available on WinXP or greater, so 98/ME/2K won't
work.
